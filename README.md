# VendingMachine


Hi,

This project is a MVC based Java project.

The program displays all of the items and their respective prices when the program starts, along with an option to exit the program.

Only one item can be vended at a time.

If the user selects an item that costs more than the amount the user put into the vending machine, the program displays a message indicating insufficient funds and then redisplays the amount the user had put into the machine.

If the user selects an item that costs equal to or less than the amount of money that the user put in the vending machine, the program displays the change returned to the user. Change must be displayed as the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies returned to the user.

Vending machine items are stored in a file. 

When an item is vended, the program updates the inventory level appropriately. If the machine runs out of an item, it is no longer be available as an option to the user. 

Thanks.
